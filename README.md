# SMS Spam Classification App

This project is a machine learning application that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using Natural Language Processing techniques.

A trained ML model is deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive prediction.

## 🧠 How it Works
1. SMS text is cleaned and preprocessed
2. Text is converted into numerical features using a vectorizer
3. A supervised ML classifier predicts spam or ham
4. The trained model is saved and reused in the web app
